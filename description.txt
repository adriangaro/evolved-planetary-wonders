[*] Megacorp branch office wonders now provide hired/private jobs instead of the normal variants where applicable, all of them provide Consulars like most Evolved branch office buildings.

[h1]Motivation[/h1]
Planteary Wonders is an amazing mod and while it works great with Evolved, wanted more integration for consistency and immersion.

[h1]Future Possible Changes/To Do[/h1]
[list]
[*] Add more effects/wonders for new Evolved ethics and civics if possible.
[*] Add branch office wonders for empathic gestalt planets, and add branch office wonders for cooperative gestalt to use on other empires (or reuse existing ones).
[*] Move some of the reusable logic to either Evolved and Planetary Wonders where it make sense (with modder approval).

For the insights and help he has given me to balance this around Stellaris Evolved. A great overhaul without which I can't play.
